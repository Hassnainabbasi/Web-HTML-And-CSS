        <dt>1: Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs:</dt>
        <dd>This is probably the best explanation I’ve ever seen about modern frontend development workflow, and if you
            are new to JavaScript or web development, you must read this article.
<br/><br/>
            You will learn so much about JavaScript by just reading this one article. If you have looked at JavaScript<br/><br/>

            It lists all the technologies and tools a Web developer should be familiar with.
            <br/><br/>
            I really liked those mind-maps which appear now in many other places on the web. It effectively complements

        <dt>3. Web Architecture 101:</dt>
        <dd>The basic architecture concepts which I believe every web developer should learn and understand. If you have
            just started with web development, you may find it complicated, but it’s worth reading. I won’t say much, as
            the below diagram says it all.
            <br/><br/>
            I always try to understand the flow before doing any change or while debugging issues. Once you know
            workflow like where is the input coming from, where is the logic and data, and how the response is returned
            makes a lot of difference in your day-to-day work.
            <br/><br/>
            And, If you’re looking for a complete course on web application and software architecture, I recommend

        <dt>4. Modern CSS Explained For Dinosaur:</dt>
        <dd>This is another masterpiece from Peter Jang, author of the very first article in this list, but this time,
            he has covered CSS, another pillar of web development.
            <br/><br/>

            article will bring you up to speed.

            understanding and using the language. This article will teach you some JavaScript fundamentals which many
            web developers overlook.

            of these questions have been answered in this article.
